# Github Simple Command

## Git Clone
`git clone` is used for just downloading exactly what is currently working on the remote server repository and saving it in your machine's folder where that project is placed. (Only one time)

## Git Fetch
`git fetch` just "downloads" the changes from the remote to your local repository. 

## Git Pull
`git pull` is a (clone(download) + merge) operation and mostly used when you are working as teamwork. (Can be multiple time if there is new changes on the repo). git pull downloads the changes and merges them into your current branch.
